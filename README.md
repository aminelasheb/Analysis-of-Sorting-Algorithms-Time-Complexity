# Analysis-of-Sorting-Algorithms-Time-Complexity
I compared the time complexity of bubble, selection, insertion, quick and merge sort algorithms in Python by measuring their performance on random lists of different sizes. The results were visualized using Matplotlib and predictions for a given number of integers were made using linear regression from scikit-learn.
